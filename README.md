# ft_printf
Unlock forbidden function for 42 future curriculum.

### Compatibility:
Working with macOS High Sierra version 10.13.4\
Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1)\
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin17.5.0\
Thread model: posix

Goal: Reproduces the behavior of printf (attempted without malloc)

##### Note:
About my printf:

1. Estimated to be around 6% speed of the original printf
2. No use of malloc or buffer

##### What I learned:

Speed:
* System call reduces speed. Reduce the amount of write function calls will speed up the function.
* Reduce the amount of hard-coding to get the right behavior. ðŸ˜‚
  * Most of the hard-coding are mainly for calculating spaces and handling modifiers

Data structure:
* Use of bits to handle flags
* Dispatch table
* Parsing variadic function.

Not one of the best project, but one of the longest.
